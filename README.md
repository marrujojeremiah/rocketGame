ðŸš€ Rocket Game
Overview
The Rocket Game is an interactive, text-based simulation designed to engage users in the fundamental physics and calculations involved in launching a rocket into low Earth orbit (LEO). This project demonstrates a solid understanding of basic physics, mathematics, and programming principles, while also showcasing skills in algorithm development, problem-solving, and user interaction.

Features
Interactive Simulation: Guides the user through a series of calculations critical to a successful rocket launch.
Real-World Physics: Incorporates real-world physics equations, such as escape velocity, thrust-to-weight ratio, and g-force calculations.
Error Handling: Provides feedback on user input and guides the user towards the correct calculations.
Learning-Oriented: Designed to be both educational and engaging, making complex concepts accessible and fun.

Technologies Used
Java: The entire game logic is implemented in Java, demonstrating proficiency in object-oriented programming and basic algorithmic concepts.
Git: Version control managed through Git and hosted on GitHub, showcasing the ability to work with version control systems.

How It Works
Escape Velocity Calculation: The game begins by introducing the concept of escape velocity, calculating the speed required for the rocket to break free from Earth's gravitational pull.
Thrust-to-Weight Ratio: The player calculates the rocket's thrust-to-weight ratio, a crucial factor in determining whether the rocket can achieve liftoff.
Net Thrust: The game then considers atmospheric drag, asking the player to calculate the net thrust available after overcoming this resistance.
Delta-v Requirements: To successfully reach LEO, the player must determine the additional delta-v required after the first stage of the launch.
G-Force Calculation: Finally, the player calculates the g-force experienced by the rocket and its crew, ensuring it remains within safe limits.
